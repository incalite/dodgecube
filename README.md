# DodgeCube

This is a very simple game written in C++ & SDL2. You are a red cube that needs to dodge other cubes. Once the score reaches 100 points the game is won.
I made this game to get a better handle regarding some the core concepts of SDL2, using Surfaces, Textures, Audio, Events and game state management.
Feel free to use it as a learning template.
